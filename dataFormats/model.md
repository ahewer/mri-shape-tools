# Multilinear Model YAML Format

## Overview

This is the YAML data structure of the multilinear model that is output by [model-builder](../model-builder).
Currently, the multilinear model represents two subspaces, one for the speaker anatomy and another one for tongue pose, that are linked together by a core tensor.

The file consists of a map:

### Dimensions

Here, the dimensions of the two subspaces are stored:

- **OriginalSpeakerMode** : the original dimension of the speaker subspace that corresponds to the amount of speakers in the used sample database
- **OriginalPhonemeMode** : original dimension of the tongue pose subspace that corresponds the amount of differenct phonemes in the sample database
- **TruncatedSpeakerMode** and **TruncatedPhonemeMode** : dimensions of the two subspaces after truncation was applied
- **VertexMode** : this is the amount of vertices of the used mesh structure multiplied by 3.

### CoreTensor

This is a tensor of third order stored in serialized manner.
The entries are furthermore saved in binary form in order to reduce the storage requirements.
The entry at *(i, j, k)* in the tensor is available at index *i TruncatedPhonemeMode VertexMode + j VertexMode + k*.

### MeanWeights

- **SpeakerMode** : The mean coordinate of all speakers in the speaker subspace
- **PhonemeMode** : The mean coordinate of all phonemes in the phoneme subspace


### ShapeSpace

This map entry provides information about the shape space:

- **Origin** : These are the vertex coordinates of the mean mesh in serialized manner: [x0, y0, z0, x1, x2, y2, z2, ...].
- **Faces** : A list containing the faces of the meshes that are generated by the model. A face itself is a list of vertex indices.

## Example

```yaml
Dimensions:
  OriginalSpeakerMode: 9
  OriginalPhonemeMode: 7
  TruncatedSpeakerMode: 6
  TruncatedPhonemeMode: 5
  VertexMode: 9300
CoreTensor: !!binary [....]
MeanWeights:
  SpeakerMode: [...]
  PhonemeMode: [...]
ShapeSpace:
  Origin: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...]
  Faces: [[0, 1, 2], [2, 3, 4], ...]
```
