# match-template

## Introduction

Performs template matching by applying the approach of [Wuhrer et al.][1].
By default, only the one-ring neighbors of a vertex are used for evaluating the smoothness energy.
Currently, meshes in OBJ and PLY format are supported.

## Installation

### Requirements

- [ann](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~mount/ANN)
- [armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net)
- [jsoncpp](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp)
- [itk](https://itk.org)
- [cmake](https://cmake.org)

### Installation Process

- configuration, adapt the installation path if needed
```sh
cmake cmake/CMakeLists.txt -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/usr/bin
```
- installation
```sh
make install
```
## Usage

```sh
    ./match-template --target string --source string --output string [ --landmarks string =  ]
                   [ --meshNeighborhood string =  ] [ --smoothnessTermWeight double = 1 ]
                   [ --smoothnessTermWeightEnd double = 1 ] [ --postSmoothnessTermWeight double = 0 ]
                   [ --landmarkTermWeight double = 1 ] [ --landmarkTermWeightEnd double = 1 ]
                   [ --geodesicNeighbors double = 2 ] [ --sphericalNeighbors double = 2 ]
                   [ --iter int = 10 ] [ --convergenceFactor int = 10000000 ]
                   [ --projectedGradientTolerance double = 1e-05 ] [ --maxFunctionEvals int = 1000 ]
                   [ --maxDistance double = 5 ] [ --maxAngle double = 60 ] [ --searchRadius double = 0 ]
                   [ --fixedNeighbors ] [ --useNoProjection ]
```

- **target** : target point cloud
- **source**  : template mesh
- **output** : matched mesh
- **landmarks** : landmarks in [JSON format][2]
- **meshNeighborhood** : JSON file containing precomputed neighborhoods of the mesh vertices used in the smoothness term
- **smoothnessTermWeight** : weight for the smoothness energy
- **smoothnessTermWeightEnd** : weight for the smoothness energy in the last iteration, weight will linearly decrease.
- **postSmoothnessTermWeight** : weight for the smoothness energy in the postsmoothing operation that will be activated if this flag is provided
- **landmarkTermWeight** : weight for the landmark energy
- **landmarkTermWeightEnd** : weight for the landmark energy in the last iteration, weight will linearly decrease.
- **geodesicNeighbors** : add geodesic neighbors within the provided distance to the vertex neighbors that are used for evaluating the smoothness energy
- **sphericalNeighbors** : add neighbors within a sphere with the provided radius to the vertex neighbors that are used for evaluating the smoothness energy
- **iter** : iterations to perform. In each iteration, the nearest neighbors are updated.
- **maxDistance** : maximally allowed distance for nearest neighbors to be considered.
- **maxAngle** : maximally allowed angle difference between nearest neighbor normal and current model mesh normal to be considered.
- **searchDistance** : search radius for adaptive nearest neighbor search. If this settings is used, nearest neighbors are preferred that lie below the current model mesh surface.
- **fixedNeighbors** : no nearest neighbor search is performed. If this setting is used, a one-to-one correspondence between model mesh and target vertices is assumed.
- **useNoProjection** : deactivate the projection of the model vertex onto the normal plane of the nearest neighbor and use nearest neighbor directly.

The remaining settings are specific to the LBFGS solver of ITK.
